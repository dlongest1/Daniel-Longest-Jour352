  <h2>Smithsonian, National Gallery to close as <br> coronavirus cases spike<h2>

<p>
  The Smithsonian will close the National Zoo and the seven museums it had reopened in stages since July and the National Gallery of Art will shutter its galleries in response to the Washington region’s recent spike in coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>  The Smithsonian’s second pandemic-related closure will begin Monday and will last at least through January, officials said. The National Gallery of Art will close Friday at 4 p.m.</p>

<p>  Similar shutdowns were announced earlier this week in Philadelphia and Chicago, representing the start of a second wave of shutdowns eight months after covid-19 first prompted widespread closures.</p>

<p>  National Gallery of Art Director Kaywin Feldman and Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III decided to take action after monitoring the recent rise in coronavirus cases being reported.</p>

<p>  “We both expressed growing concern about the increased number of cases in the region and across the country and came to the conclusion that caution needed to prevail to protect our visitors and staff,” Feldman said.
</p>
<p>
The National Gallery of Art opened its sculpture garden in mid-June, its ground-floor galleries (to limited capacity) in July and some of its main galleries in the West Building just a few weeks ago, on Oct. 26. All will probably remain closed through January, although the museum will continually evaluate the situation.</p>
<p>
“It can’t help but feel like a step backward,” Feldman said about the decision. “But what’s different this time is we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The prospect of a vaccine lifts our spirits. We have big plans for next year and lots to look forward to. We need to keep people safe in this period.”</p>

  "...caution needed to prevail to protect our visitors and staff,” Feldman said.

<p>
The Smithsonian began a multistage reopening July 24, when the National Zoo and the National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Va., were the first to welcome back visitors after being closed for four months. The Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Renwick Gallery reopened Sept. 18, with the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of the American Indian opening their doors a week later.</p>
<p>
The Hirshhorn Museum’s sculpture garden and the Smithsonian gardens surrounding its administration building reopened in August and will remain open now.</p>
<p>
The decision to close the museums and zoo was made out of caution, Bunch emphasized, adding that cases are projected to rise after next week’s holiday, typically a busy time for the museums.</p>
<p>
“I didn’t want to wait until we were in a crisis,” Bunch said. “We always said as long as [cases in] the District, Maryland and Virginia were on a downward slope, we’d keep the Smithsonian open. As they are now ratcheting up, the prudent thing is to protect our staff and visitors.”</p>
<p>
The eight facilities recorded about a half million visits since the summer, a small fraction of typical attendance. The low numbers were partially intentional, with the museums capping attendance and operating on a reduced schedule. Only about 60 percent of passes were being used.</p>

  “I didn’t want to wait until we were in a crisis,” Bunch said.

<p>
Bunch expects the shutdown to last through January. Smithsonian officials will monitor guidance from local governments, public health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine its reopening strategy, he said. The first eight months of the pandemic have cost the world’s largest museum complex more than $50 million; this second closure will increase those losses.</p>
<p>
“It’s important to recognize, just as before, that while we are closing the buildings, the Smithsonian is still open online,” he added.</p>
